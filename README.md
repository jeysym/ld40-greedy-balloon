In this game you are a greedy hot air balloon travelling through mountains. You can pick there your favourite gold bars and carry them with you - but beware! They are gold bars and therefore heavy. You can encounter dangerous birds. Hopefully, you can kill them by throwing away your difficulty earned gold bars. Try to survive the path with as much gold bars as possible!

We made this game during 24 hours for Jam event. All assets were made by us. Only exception being the font [COMPUTER SPEAK][2]. Used technologies:

* **Unity3D**
